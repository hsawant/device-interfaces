Medical Device "Plug-and-Play" Program
======================================

(from http://www.mdpnp.org)

The Medical Device “Plug-and-Play” (MD PnP) Interoperability Program 
is accelerating the adoption of medical device interoperability to 
enable the creation of complete and accurate electronic health records 
and the cost-effective development of innovative third-party medical 
“apps” for diagnosis, treatment, research, safety and quality 
improvements, equipment management, and adverse event detection and 
reporting when using networked medical devices for clinical care. 

MD PnP Device Interfaces
========================

This software library includes an API for message-oriented interaction 
with various medical devices as well as specific prototype 
implementations of that API for the devices with which we have
experimented in our lab.

Audience
========

Other researchers in the area of interoperability are encouraged to 
use this software for the purposes of concept proving and demonstration.
Medical devices interacting with this software are expected to be in a 
"demonstration" mode or interacting only with an electro-mechanical
simulator.


Goals
=====

Provide a uniform API for interacting (bidirectionally) with medical
devices

Lower the barrier to entry into interoperability research by furnishing
new researchers with tools that will allow rapid development of their
own prototypes and experimental software.

Provide a basic set of messages for common interactions with devices
without preventing the exposure of any novel or device-specific 
features or functionality.

Provide a platform for easy "binding" to any message-oriented transport
while keeping this library transport-agnostic.

Feed lessons learned back into the development of interoperability
for new devices
